IN ADDITION TO MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS CRYPTANALYSIS INCLUDES THE STUDY OF SIDE CHANNEL ATTACKS THAT DO NOT TARGET WEAKNESSES IN THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS THEMSELVES BUT IN STEAD EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION EVEN THOUGH THE GOAL HAS BEEN THE SAME THEME THOD SAND TECHNIQUES OF CRYPTANALYSIS HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY THROUGH THE HISTORY OF CRYPTOGRAPHY ADAPTING TO INCREASING CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY RANGING FROM THE PEN AND PAPER METHODS OF THE PAST THROUGH MACHINES LIKE THE BRITISH BOMBES AND COLOSSUS COMPUTERS AT BLETCHLEY PARK IN WORLD WAR II TO THE MATHEMATICALLY ADVANCED COMPUTERIZED SCHEMES OF THE PRESENT METHODS FOR BREAKING MODERN CRYPTO SYSTEMS OFTEN INVOLVE SOLVING CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED PROBLEMS IN PURE MATHEMATICS THE BEST KNOWN BEING INTEGER FACTORIZATION
